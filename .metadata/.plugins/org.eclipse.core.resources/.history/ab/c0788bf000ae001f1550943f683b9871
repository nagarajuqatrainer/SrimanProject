 Feature: Login Functionality

  As a user
  I want to log into the application
  So that I can access my account and personalized features

  Scenario Outline: Login with valid and invalid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters "<username>" and "<password>"
    And clicks the "Login" button
    Then the user should see "<message>"

    Examples:
      | username      | password    | message                                   |
      | validUser     | validPass   | "Welcome to your dashboard!"             |
      | invalidUser   | validPass   | "Invalid username or password."          |
      | validUser     | invalidPass | "Invalid username or password."          |
      |               |             | "Username and password cannot be empty." |
