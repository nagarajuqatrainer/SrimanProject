 Feature: Login Functionality

  As a user
  I want to log into the application
  So that I can access my account and personalized features

  Scenario Outline: Login with valid  credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters "<username>" and "<password>"
    And clicks the Login button
    Then the user should see successful login

    Examples:
      | username      | password    |              
      | validUser     | validPass   |             
      | invalidUser   | validPass   |           
      | validUser     | invalidPass |       
      |               |             |
